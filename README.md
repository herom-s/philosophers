# 42-School-C-Template

A template repository for C projects at 42 School.

## 📦 What’s inside

This project provides:

* A ready-to-use folder structure for C projects.
* Basic configuration (Makefile, folders for sources & headers, etc.).
* A helper script `create_42_project.py` to generate a project scaffold.

## ✅ Why use it

* Speeds up your setup for new C projects at 42 School.
* Promotes consistency across projects.
* Lets you focus on writing code instead of boilerplate.

## 🚀 Getting started

1. **Fork** or **clone** this repo.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/herom-s/42-School-C-Template.git
   ```
2. Run the script (optional) to create a new project based on the template:

   ```bash
   python3 create_42_project.py MyNewProject
   ```
3. Update the project name, author, subject, etc. as needed.
4. Start coding in `src/` and create headers in `inc/`.
5. Use `make` to build (if Makefile included).

## 🛠️ Usage tips

* Rename the folders and files to match your project’s subject/name.
